Mini Project 3 â€“ Network Analysis 

This project expolred into the public sentiment and reactions encapsulated by the #FacebookDown hashtag on Twitter, on user experiences during a service outage. Despite the initial plan to obtain real-time data directly from Twitter using the Twitter Developer API, limitations and access restrictions led to an alternative approach utilizing a scrapped dataset available on GitHub. 

The subsequent data analysis, spanning from the identification of the most liked tweets to sentiment and emotion analysis, provided a best understanding of user interactions, preferences, and emotional expressions during the specified period.
The sentiment analysis revealed a mixed emotional landscape, with approximately 68% of discussions expressing negative sentiments and 32% conveying positivity. 

Further emotion classification highlighted that anger dominated, comprising about 74% of the expressed emotions, followed by fear (14%) and joy (10%). Lastly, the network analysis, based on the top 100 liked tweets, showed a dynamic interaction graph with 42 nodes and 147 edges. Moreover, hashtags like "whatsappdown," "facebookdown," and "serverdown" emerged as key markers, reflecting user discussions around service disruptions on various platforms.

In essence, this comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into user behaviors and sentiments during service outages, contributing to a deeper understanding of crisis management strategies and the broader digital landscape. The visual representations, including network graphs and emotion distributions, offer a clear snapshot of the user interactions, enhancing comprehension of the collective user experience during instances of social media disruptions.
